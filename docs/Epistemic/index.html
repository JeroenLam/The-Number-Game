                <h1>
                    Model construction and logic system
                </h1>

                <h2>
                    States
                </h2>
                <p>
                To think about the logic underlying the number game, we first want to find a logical system supporting the number game.
                Therefore, we first look at what kind of models we are considering.
                An intuitive way of thinking of possible states is that they represent the possible combinations of the given numbers, for example (4,6).
                We only consider one possible state representing each number combination.
                This is because, as we will later see, we remove states that are not considered possible anymore.
                This means that we do not need states in a model with different truth evaluations or relations, as will become clearer later on.

                <h2>
                    Relations
                </h2>
                <p>
                We also need to have certain relations between the possible states.
                Let us consider the random numbers picked from 1 to 10 and let us consider the state (4,6).
                The product of these numbers is 24, and their sum is 10. This means that the 'product-possible' states are only (4,6) and (3,8).
                The 'sum-possible' states are (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6) and (5,5).
                We will connect each state which has the same sum with a relation of Alice and all states with the same product with a relation of Bob.
                
                Since all states have a relation to each state with the same sum or product, it will always have a relation to itself. Hence the model is reflexive.

                Assume we have 3 states with a relation from the first state to the second and from the second to the third. We know that the first and the second state have the same sum or product. We also know that the second and thirst have the same product or sum. Hence the first and the third also have the same sum or product and thus we can conclude that the model is transitive.

                Lastly, we also have that if a state has a relation to another state, then they have the same product or sum. Hence there will also be a relation in the other direction, i.e. the model is Euclidean.

                Since we are reasoning about knowledge and considering models that have to be reflexive, euclidean, and transitive, we make use of the corresponding modal logic system S5 for two agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                Since we have reasoned towards the <i> type </i> of models we consider, we are from this point on not constrained to models pertaining only to the number game.
                In fact, we can construct an entire class of models on which we can play 'Number Games'.
                The construction of these models can be done with many different rules, of which we also have considered some in the demo.
                Most interestingly, we do not even need to have any rules about model construction, as long as the model does conform to the reflexive, euclidean, and transitive properties.
                This even extends to models that do not use states as combinations of numbers, though for clarity we will consider only those kinds of states.
                </p>
                <p>
                We will use the usual notation of S5 for two agents, for example; K<sub>A</sub>K<sub>B</sub>p, with the meaning 'Alice knows that Bob knows that p'.

                <h2>
                    Truth valuations
                </h2>
                <p>
                We now have defined the types of relations we allow, as well as the way that our states are structured. What is left is to create a valuation at the possible states. <!-- The kind of statements that we wish to make. -->
                Every state corresponds to a possible combination of numbers. For a number combination to be possible, that number combination has to be the actual one according to the state.
                We can then derive that to be the true state, if there are no connections to different states.
                Instead of using a proposition at state <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN> corresponding to 'the numbers are x and y', at each state we will have such a corresponding proposition that holds there.
                That is, at any state <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN>, &pi;<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">((x,y))</SPAN>((x,y)) = T. Note that we distinguish between the state <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN>  and the proposition (x,y).
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Public announcement logic
                </h2>
                <p>
                From the transitivity, reflexivity and euclidean properties of our system, it follows that on this model we have the S5 logic with 2 agents, Alice and Bob.
                However, we also are using the public announcements of 'I do not know the numbers' as a way of making logical statements.
                Therefore, the logic that we will use is the public announcement logic.
                </p>
                As a summary; we will represent the Numbers Game by a model that corresponds to the public announcement logic.
                Such a model we will call M = (S, R, &pi;).
                The set of states S of this model will (initially) consist of states {<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN>|L&le;x&le;y&lt;U, x,y &isin; N}, where U and L are the integer upper and lower bound respectively.
                The set of relations consists of the transitive, reflexive, and euclidean relations, such that
                there is a sum-relation R<sub>A</sub> between <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN> and <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(u,v)</SPAN> if x+y = u+v,
                and there is a product-relation R<sub>B</sub> between <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN> and <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(u,v)</SPAN> if x*y = u*v.
                We consider the propositions P={(x,y)|<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN> &isin; S}.
                The truth evaluation of these propositions is given by &pi;<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">((x,y))</SPAN>((x,y)) = T.
                <p>
                On this model, we will use the Public Announcement logic PA.
                We will first create a shorthand notation for 'I know the numbers' for agent i which is: KN<sub>i</sub>(x,y) = &or;<sub>(x,y)|<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN>&isin; S</sub> K(x,y).
                Semantically this means that if a state is a singleton, i.e. only has a reflexive relation in R<sub>i</sub>, then KN<sub>i</sub>(x,y) will be true.
                The announcements that Alice and Bob make in terms of a public announcement can be phrased in the form: [&not;KN<sub>i</sub>(x,y)], where i=A for Alice and i=B for Bob.
                We can then study if it is possible to see if we can find the true world based on the public announcements that were made.
                Such a statement will be of the form [&not;KN<sub>A</sub>(x,y)][&not;KN<sub>B</sub>(x,y)]...[KN<sub>i</sub>(x,y)]K<sub>i+1</sub>(u,v). Where i can be A(lice) or B(ob), and i+1 B(ob) or A(lice).
                As an example, let's say Alice says she does not know, Bob says he does not know, and then Alice says she knows. After these announcements, we wish to know if Bob knows that (u,v). Then we get the statement form:
                [&not;KN<sub>A</sub>(x,y)][&not;KN<sub>B</sub>(x,y)][KN<sub>A</sub>(x,y)]K<sub>B</sub>(u,v)).
                Where we have to check if for some specific proposition (u,v) in the model, this statement holds at some state. In practice, we only have to check the state <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(u,v)</SPAN>, as K<sub>i</sub>(u,v) implies (u,v).
                If this proposition holds, then (u,v) will either already have dropped out, with the statement being vacuously true, or the state will drop out after one more announcement of 'I do not know the numbers', due to it being a singleton.
