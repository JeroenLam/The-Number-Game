                To think about the logic underlying the number game, we first want to find a logical system supporting the number game.
                Therefore, we first look at what kind of models we are considering.
                The most intuitive way of thinking of possible states is that they are possible combinations of the given numbers, for example (4,6).
                We then also need to have certain relations between the possible states, so let us say that we are in our example possible state, (4,6), and we have a number limit of 10.
                The product of these numbers is 24, and their sum is 10. This means that the 'product-possible' states are only (4,6) and (3,8).
                The 'sum-possible' states are (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6) and (5,5).
                We see that in a specific state, we have two types of connections; those connecting to states with the same sum, and those connecting to states with the same product.
                Since we have that the product and the sum of the numbers in a certain possible state are always the same, these relations, and therefore every possible model will always be reflexive.
                It is also given that if a state, for example (5,5) has a sum relation with (4,6), then there is also a sum-relation between (4,6) and (5,5); models have to be Euclidean.
                Additionally, we see that when we create a list of accessible states, they have some property that they share. Either their sum or their product will be the same.
                This implies that from the 'sum-possible' states when there is a 'sum'-connection between (4,6) and (5,5) and between (4,6) and (3,7), there has to be a connection between (5,5) and (3,7) because they all add up to 10.
                Models that we are considering therefore also have to be transitive.
                Since we are reasoning about knowledge and considering models that have to be reflexive, euclidean, and transitive, we make use of the corresponding modal logic system S5 for two agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                We can now write, using the usual notation of S5 for two agents, K<sub>a</sub>K<sub>b</sub>p with the meaning 'Alice knows that Bob knows that p'.
                </p>
                <p>
                We now have defined the types of relations we allow, as well as the way that our states are structured. What is left is to create a valuation at the possible states. The kind of statements that we wish to make.
                Within the game we are considering, the only possible proposition at a state is 'this is the true state'. In all the states we consider possible, however, we do not know whether or not it is the real state.
                Instead of using a proposition like 'this is the true state', at each state we will have a corresponding proposition that holds there.
                That is, at any state <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN>, we have a proposition (x,y) that is true.
                These propositions (x,y) seem to be all the propositions that we need in a state. But there is one problem; we need to be able to distinguish between states we belief to possibly be the true state, and all other statess.
                Therefore, we put a 'marker' proposition at each of the states connected by the information of the number we got.
                This proposition helps us keep track of the solvability from one perspective, and at each step we will consider the model constructed from one agent's perspective only.
                </p>
                <p>
                From the transitivity, reflexivity and euclidean properties of our system, it follows that on this model we have the S5 logic with 2 agents, Alice and Bob.
                However, we also are using the public announcements of `I do not know the numbers' as a way of making logical statements.
                Therefore, the logic that we will use is the public announcement logic.
                </p>
                As a summary; we will represent the Numbers Game by a model that corresponds to the public announcement logic.
                Such a model we will call M = (S, R, &pi;, P).
                The set of states S of this model will consist of states <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN>
                The set of relations consists of the transitive, reflexive, and euclidean relations, such that
                there is a sum-relation between <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN> and <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(u,v)</SPAN> if x+y = u+v,
                and there is a product-relation between <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN> and <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(u,v)</SPAN> if x*y = u*v.
                We consider the propositions P={(x,y)|<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN> &isin; S} &cup; {mark<sub>a</sub>} &cup; {mark<sub>b</sub>}.
                The truth evaluation is given by &pi;<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN>(x,y) = T, &pi;<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN>(mark<sub>a</sub>) = T if x+y = N<sub>a</sub>,
                and &pi;<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">(x,y)</SPAN>(mark<sub>b</sub>) = T if x*y = N<sub>b</sub>.
                <p>
                An example of a formal proof is shown below. It is assumed that the numbers are below 6 and that Alice received the number 5. The proof shows that if Bob states
                that he does not know, Alice knows that the numbers are 1 and 4. The rules N1-N4 express general knowledge about the game. N1 states that the number N_B that Bob receives
                is the product of the two numbers and N2 expresses that the number N_A that Alice receives is the sum of both numbers. N3 expresses that Bob only considers the number combinations
                possible that have a product of N_B and similarly, N4 expresses that Alice only considers number combinations
                possible that have a sum of N_A.
