                    For our project we will consider the generalization of the following logic puzzle.
                    <hr>
                    Assume we have 2 agents, Alice and Bob, both are perfect logicians. Let us pick 2 random positive integers smaller than 100. We tell Alice the sum of these numbers and we tell Bob the product of these numbers. Both know this. Then the following conversations occurs between the agents:
                    <br> <br>
            
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    <br>
                    Bob: I do know the numbers! <br>
                    <br>
                    What are the numbers?

                        Background of the puzzle
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        This problem is also know as the "Sum and Product" problem which is a variation of the  Freudenthal problem presented in 1969 [1]. An formal analysis using Epistemic knowledge for the Sum and Prodct problem model exists for example in [2]. In this paper the authors motivate the use of public announcement logic to model the problem.

                    <h2>
                        Example on how to solve the problem
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Below we will start by providing an example on how this problem can be solved if we look at a simpler variant of the problem. Let us consider the problem in which we pick our random numbers on the interval [1,6) instead of [1,100). Then we can compute the sums and products for all pairs of random numbers in the problem.

                    sums = { <br>
                        2  : [(1,1)], <br>
                        3  : [(1,2)], <br>
                        4  : [(1,3), (2,2)], <br>
                        5  : [(1,4), (2,3)], <br>
                        6  : [(1,5), (2,4), (3,3)], <br>
                        7  : [(2,5), (3,4)], <br>
                        8  : [(3,5), (4,4)], <br>
                        9  : [(4,5)], <br>
                        10 : [(5,5)], <br>
                    } <br>
                    products = { <br>
                        1  : [(1,1)], <br>
                        2  : [(1,2)], <br>
                        3  : [(1,3)], <br>
                        4  : [(1,4), (2,2)], <br>
                        5  : [(1,5)], <br>
                        6  : [(2,3)], <br>
                        8  : [(2,4)], <br>
                        9  : [(3,3)], <br>
                        10 : [(2,5)], <br>
                        12 : [(3,4)], <br>
                        15 : [(3,5)], <br>
                        16 : [(4,4)], <br>
                        20 : [(4,5)], <br>
                        25 : [(5,5)], <br>
                    } <br> <br>
            
                    <p>
                        We can use this representation to easily find all the states in which an agent 'would know' the numbers. Let us consider the agent Alice and Alice knows that the sum is 8. Then the states (3,5) and (4,4) are equally likely from the perspective of Alice. If we reverse this reasoning, if Alice knows that there is only one possible pair for her sum value, then she knows the original numbers, namely that pair. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Bob announces that he does not know the numbers, then we know that it is not any product with only a single possible pair. We can then reduce the set of possible pairs by removing all pairs which do not have any other pairs with the same product. This would result in the following sets:
                    </p>
            
                    removed = { <br>
                        [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] <br>
                    }<br>
                    sums = { <br>
                        4  : [(2,2)], <br>
                        5  : [(1,4)], <br>
                    } <br>
                    products = { <br>
                        4  : [(1,4), (2,2)], <br>
                    } <br> <br>
            
                    <p>
                        After Bob stated that he does not know, Alcice will know (If the number that Alice revived was 4, then she would know that it must be the pair (2,2). Similarly, if she recived a 5, hten she knows that the pair is (1,4)). If Bob did know the numbers in the first step then Alice would know that the numbers correspond to a pair in the 'removed' set above. 
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        The process of an agent stating that she does not know and removing the corresponding options can be repeated to obtain all pairs removed during a sequence of step. However, we would like to note that it is not always the case that all states are removed by this process.
                    </p>

                        Overview

                    <p>     
                        In the next sections (accessible using the bar at the top) we will discuss how we can formulate this problem to epistemic logic as well as looking at how we can create an algorithm that finds all pairs that can be deduced by the agents in both the context of formal logic and a computer algorithm. We have also implemented this algorithm using javascript to provide a visual and interactive demo of the algorithm. Lastly we have added an appendix indicating how the problem can be attempted without using public announcements.
                        The question we wish to answer is: Which number combinations are derivable, and if they are derivable, how many steps does it take to derive them?
