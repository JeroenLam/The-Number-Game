                    For our project we will consider the following logic puzzle.
                    <hr>
                    Assume we have 2 agents, Alice and Bob, both are perfect logicians. Let us pick 2 random positive integers smaller than 100. We tell Alice the sum of these numbers and we tell Bob the product of these numbers. Both know this. Then the following conversations occurs between the agents:
                    <br> <br>
            
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Bob: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    Alice: I do not know the numbers. <br>
                    <br>
                    Bob: I do know the numbers! <br>
                    <br>
                    What are the numbers?
                    <hr>

                    <p>
                        The puzzle is very similar to Rinekes birthday problem discussed during the course. However, there is a key differenct. In Rinekes birthday puzzle we assume the identity of one of the agents. However, in this puzzle we are a third agent who has no impact on the conversation and is only able to listen. Later on we will also consider this puzzle from the perspective of the agents.
                        The problem looks quite intimidating at first, but the problem reduces relatively quickly when using a computer. We will start by noting that the pairs of numbers have no inherent ordering to them, hence the pairs (3,7) and (7,3) are equivalent. From here on we will denote each pair as (x,y) with x<=y. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the sake of explanation, let us assume that the random numbers are chosen between [1,6) instead of [1,100). We will use this reduced example to show how we can reduce the set of possible number combinations for each anounchement. 
                    </p>
                    
                    sums = { <br>
                        2  : [(1,1)], <br>
                        3  : [(1,2)], <br>
                        4  : [(1,3), (2,2)], <br>

                        9  : [(4,5)], <br>
                        10 : [(5,5)], <br>
                    } <br>
                    products = { <br>
                        1  : [(1,1)], <br>
                        2  : [(1,2)], <br>
                        3  : [(1,3)], <br>
                        4  : [(1,4), (2,2)], <br>
                        5  : [(1,5)], <br>
                        6  : [(2,3)], <br>
                        8  : [(2,4)], <br>
                        9  : [(3,3)], <br>
                        10 : [(2,5)], <br>
                        12 : [(3,4)], <br>
                        15 : [(3,5)], <br>
                        16 : [(4,4)], <br>
                        20 : [(4,5)], <br>
                        25 : [(5,5)], <br>
                    } <br> <br>
            
                    <p>
                    Then, when Bob announced that they do not know the numbers, then we know that it is not any product with only a single possible pair. We can then reduce the set of possible pairs by removing all pairs which do not have any other pairs with the same product. This would result in the following sets:
                    </p>
            
                    removed = { <br>
                        [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] <br>
                    }<br>
                    sums = { <br>
                        4  : [(2,2)], <br>
                        5  : [(1,4)], <br>
                    } <br>
                    products = { <br>
                        4  : [(1,4), (2,2)], <br>
                    } <br> <br>
            
                    <p>
                    If Bob did know the numbers in the first step then Alice would know that the numbers correspond to a pair in the 'removed' set above. Similarly, when Alice announces that they do not know the number, we can remove all pairs for which there does not exist another pair with the same sum from the set of possible pairs. If we do this we get the following sets:
                    </p>
            
                    removed = { <br>
                        [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)], <br>
                        [(2,2), (1,4)] <br>
                    }<br>
                    sums = {} <br>
                    products = {} <br> <br>
            
                    <p>
                        This can be repeated to obtain all nodes removed during each step. However, we would like to note that the problem is only solvable for for the 3rd agent in case only a single pair is removed by an announcement. If there are multiple pairs that are removed by the anounchement then the 3rd agent only knows that it is one of these pairs of numbers but not which one, as is the case in our example.
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                        As one might imagine this indicates that there are quite significant constraints on the original problem for a solution to exists for a given (fixed) number of 'Agent x does not know the numbers'. Hence we will also be looking an extention of the problem in which we consider ourselves to be one of the agents with knowledge about the received product or sum.

                        From the perspective of an playing agent.
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                    Let's play the game out of Bob's perspective and assume that the number
                    games is played with x, y being in a range of [1,6)] and we receive a number N<sub>B</sub>
                    which is 4. Alice receives a number N<sub>A</sub> but this number is unknown for us.
                    We know that x * y = N<sub>B</sub> and that 0 < x, y < 6. There are two possible
                    combinations of (x, y) possible which are (2, 2) and (1, 4).
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                    If the numbers are (2, 2), then N<sub>A</sub> = 4 and Alice would consider (2, 2) or
                    (3, 1) as possible. Similarly, if the numbers are (4, 1) then N<sub>A</sub> = 5 and Alice
                    would consider (4, 1) and (3, 2) as possible. Either way, we know that Alice does
                    not know the combination.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                    We considers it possible that (2, 2) with N<sub>A</sub> = 4 and Alice considering (2, 2)
                    and (3, 1). However, if (3, 1) then N<sub>B</sub> = 3 which means that (x, y) must be
                    (3, 1) (The only possible numbers with a product of 3). Therefore Alice would
                    consider it possible that we know (3, 1). We consider it possible that Alice
                    considers it possible that we know the combination.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                    Now, we announce that we do not know (x, y).
                    Do we still know that Alice does not know (x, y)? We consider it possible
                    that (2, 2) with N<sub>A</sub> = 4. If N<sub>A</sub> = 4 then Alice would know that either (2, 2)
                    or (3, 1). However, Alice knows that (3, 1) is not possible because we stated
                    that we do not know (If (3, 1) then N<sub>B</sub> = 3 and we would know since the only
                    possible product is (1, 3)). Therefore Alice would eliminate (3, 1) and conclude
                    the only possible option which is (2, 2). Therefore should we should consider it
                    possible that Alice knows (2, 2).
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                    Do we know that Alice knows (x, y)? We consider (2, 2) and (4, 1) as possible.
                    As already explained, if (2, 2), then Alice would know (2, 2), after we states that
                    we do not know. If on the other hand (4, 1), then N<sub>A</sub> = 5 and Alice would
                    consider (4, 1) or (3, 2) as possible. However, if (3, 2) then N<sub>B</sub> = 6 and the only
                    possible products are (3, 2). Alice can eliminate (3, 2) because we stated that
                    we do not know. Therefore Alice would know (4, 1). So we know that Alice
                    either knows (2, 2) or of (1, 4).
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                    So after we stated that we do not know, Alice states that she knows. Unfortunately this is old news for us and we still do not know if (2, 2) or (1, 4). An Kripke model that visualizes this is shown below.
                    </p>

                    In order to find the solution to the provided puzzle we need to find the pair which is removed at the 15'th announcement. 
                    This solution can easily be computed using the provided code (TODO, update this). When running the code we find that the pair (77,84) is removed at this iteration.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                    However, for this puzzle we assumed that at a specific point in the conversation one of the agents knew the numbers. 
                    However, one may ask if there always exists a solution to this problem assuming 2 arbitrary random integers below a predefined threshold. 
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                    In the next section we will look at the generalizability of this problem and look if there are specific conditions which are necessary and or sufficient for convergence. 
                    We will also restate the puzzle in terms of a logic language (TODO: more specific) and consider if the problem can still be solved without the prior knowledge about the upper bound of the generated random numbers.
                    </p>
